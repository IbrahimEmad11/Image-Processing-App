## Image Processing tool

A Python and PyQt5 based desktop application for advanced image processing. This application provides a variety of image manipulation features including filters, edge detection, histogram analysis, high pass and low pass filters, thresholding, normalization, equalization, and hybrid image generation with customizable cutoff frequencies.

### Features

- **Filters**: Apply average, Gaussian, and median filters to images.
- **Edge Detection**: Perform Canny, Sobel, Roberts, and Prewitt edge detection.
- **High Pass and Low Pass Filters**: Implement high pass and low pass filters in the frequency domain.
- **Histogram Analysis**: Generate and display RGB histograms and cumulative distribution functions.
- **Thresholding, Normalization, and Equalization**: Apply global and local thresholding, image normalization, and histogram equalization.
- **Hybrid Image Generation**: Create hybrid images using low pass and high pass filters with adjustable cutoff frequencies.

### Modules

- `filters.py`: Functions for average, Gaussian, and median filtering.
- `edge_detection.py`: Functions for Canny, Sobel, Roberts, and Prewitt edge detection.
- `hp_lp_filters.py`: Functions for applying high pass and low pass filters.
- `histogram.py`: Functions for generating and displaying histograms.
- `threshold_normalization_equalization.py`: Functions for thresholding, normalization, and equalization.
